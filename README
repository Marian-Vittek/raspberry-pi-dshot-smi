This is an implementation of the DSHOT protocol to control ESCs
via the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It was developed and used on
Raspberry Pi Zero 2, other version of may not work.

Comparing to a simple implementation based on busy wait loop this
implementation is using SMI interface and DMA to generate dshot
protocol. It is less CPU consuming and works well even if CPU is
loaded by other tasks. However, it is more hardware dependent and can
not generate Dshot signal on any GPIO pin. It works for pins between
GPIO 8 and GPIO 25 (18 pins max).

SMI and DMA implementation is based on Jeremy Benthem work
https://iosoft.blog/category/secondary-memory-interface/.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors, type

    	   make test
	   sudo ./test

If it does not work, you may need to edit 'motor-dshot-smi.c' and adjust
DSHOT_VERSION and/or DSHOT_SMI_TIMING macro.
